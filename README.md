# Visual Analytics Lab Project 2020/21
Submission template for the Visual Analytics lab project at the Johannes Kepler University Linz.

**Explanation:**
This `README.md` needs to be updated and pushed to github for the first and the final deadline.
Change/extend the corresponding sections by replacing the [TODO] markers.
*In order to meet the deadlines make sure you push everything to your Github repository.*
For more details see Visual Analytics [Moodle page Assignment 4](https://moodle.jku.at/jku/course/view.php?id=11328#section-7).

**Tip:** Make yourself familiar with [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

### Dataset

## Our dataset is a combination of several [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) datasets

* Economy -> Incomes and growth -> GDP total, yearly growth
* Education -> Gender equality -> Gender ratio of mean years in school
* Environment -> Emission -> CO2 emissions per person
* Health -> New Born & Infants -> Babies per woman (total fertility)

Economy -> Economic Situation -> Hourly compensation
Economy -> Economic Situation -> Working hours per week
Economy -> Incomes and growth -> Income
Health -> Mental Health -> Suicide/100k people 
Health -> Nutrition -> Food Supply
Health -> Risk Factors -> Body Mass Index/Fat in blood/Blood pressure
Economy -> Poverty & Inequality -> average age of dollar billionaires
Economy -> Poverty & Inequality -> dollar billionaires
Education -> Gender equality -> ratio girls/boys in school

## Usage

proposal:
descriptive statistics -> line chart to show trends over time e.g. fertility, co2 emissions per person or boxplots using two selected years to show change over time or bar charts to show ranking of suicide, dollar billionaires,...
correlations between attributes -> use heatmap to answer question of does hourly compensation, working hours per week or income correlate to suicide rate, intake of calories, BMI, fat in blood, blood pressure?
cluster similar items -> max. 4 attributes (x, y axis, category, size) in first visualization selectable by e.g. year, continent, country, second visualization detail of first visualization

### Locally
Checkout this repo and change into the folder:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jku-icg-classroom/va-project-2020-<GROUP_NAME>.git
cd va-project-2020-<GROUP_NAME>
```

Load the conda environment from the `environment.yml` file, if you haven't already in previous assignments:

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the loaded conda environment:

```sh
conda activate python-tutorial
```

Install Jupyter Lab extension to use *ipywidgets* in JupyterLab:

```sh
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
```

Launch Jupyter :

```shell
jupyter lab
```

Jupyter should open a new tab with url http://localhost:8888/ and display the tutorial files.

### MyBinder
Go to: https://mybinder.org/ and paste your repository url to work online.
MyBinder installs the dependencies specified inside of the `environment.yml` for you.

By default, it will launch to Jupyter Notebook, but you can switch to Jupyter Lab by simply appending `?urlpath=lab` to the URL.

Note: MyBinder can not save to your repository, you need to download the notebooks and update the repository yourself!

## Final Submission
*Due on 11.01.2021.*

* Make sure that you pushed your GitHub repository and not just committed it locally.
* Sending us an email with the code is not necessary.
* Please update the *environment.yml* file if you need additional libraries, otherwise the code is not executeable.
* Save your final executed notebooks as html and add them to your repository.  
  Select 'File' -> 'Export Notebook As...' -> 'Export Notebook to HTML'
